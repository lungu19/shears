# Shears ✂️
Are you tired of each Old Siege version taking up 50-60 GB (or more) of your valuable disk space? Shears is a simple utility designed to significantly reduce the file size of your Old Siege installations while keeping the game fully functional at your desired quality level. It can free up a massive amount of disk space, often reducing the total size by 50-75%.

![Shears](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lungu19/shears/refs/heads/main/assets/screenshot1.png)

## How?
Shears achieves this by intelligently deleting unnecessary files, such as high-quality texture ones. For instance, if you only play on 'Low' texture settings, there's no need to keep the 'Medium', 'High', and 'Ultra' textures, which consume gigabytes of space. Shears lets you remove them safely.

## Instructions
> [!WARNING]
> ⚠️ Important Note: This Process is Irreversible.
> **'Shearing' a game installation is a destructive and irreversible action.** The tool permanently deletes files from the game's installation.
>
> To reverse this process will have to verify your installation and **re-download** any affected files.

Using Shears is incredibly easy:
 1. **Select  the Siege Folder:** Select the Siege folder using the button or by dragging and dropping it into the tool
 2. **Choose what to keep:** Select the **highest** texture quality you want to **keep**. All textures for quality levels above your selection will be deleted. 
 3. **Shear!:** Click the Shear button and you're done!
